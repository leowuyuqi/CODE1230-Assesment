							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="Olympic/ta.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Olympic Park is building for the Olympic game which hold in beijing 2008.The park covers an area of 680 hectares, including 380 hectares in the south and 300 hectares in the north.Park forest resources, mainly to trees and shrubs, greening coverage of 95.61%. Olympic Park used to be a natrual forest so government decide to use it improve and protect the environment.it is placed in Beijing between 4th round and 5th round.So it means Olympic park is a huge park with a high rate of plant coverage </p>
							<p>For tourist who play in the park, they are looking for a peaceful and leanning places. in a research by a uni's case study, it shows the level of noise in Olympic park is 76.7% lower than road out of park, and the pm2.5 is also m86.5%lower than outside.(The North China University of Technology,case study by He Shuang,Geng Chao,Yang Xin)</p>
							<p>By 2008, the park had more than 100 species of 530,000 trees, more than 80 shrubs and more than 100 groundcover plants, forming a natural forest system based on biodiversity.From it built till now the park has already produces 5,400 tons of oxygen, assimilate 32 tons of sulfur dioxide and 4,905 tons of dust for trees.<p>
							<p>The Olympic forest park is the first large-scale city park to fully adopt the ecological and energy-saving building technology.The park buildings all adopted the ecological compensation technology to different degrees, achieving the goal of energy saving of 50% ~ 65%.
The design and construction of China's first large-scale ecological corridor across expressway within the city, and the gradual transition of forest park system from island type to network type, maintain the continuity of urban ecological green space system and pattern, safeguard biodiversity, protect species and habitat, and contribute to urban ecological security.
The park's eco-water treatment shows that greenhouse is the first of its kind in China's urban parks, and it is the first large-scale urban park in China to fully adopt rainwater collection technology. Through various engineering and non-engineering means, 95% of the park's rainfall is collected, equivalent to about 1.34 million cubic meters of rain per year.It is used for greening irrigation and road spraying to ensure the full, comprehensive and efficient water resource conservation within the forest park and the water circulation within the park.The park also USES state-of-the-art intelligent irrigation systems that can save 1 million cubic meters of water a year compared with conventional irrigation methods.
The park takes the lead in realizing zero sewage discharge (including toilet discharge) in Chinese urban parks, and the sewage is recycled after ecological treatment.The park adopts advanced water treatment technologies such as MBR biofilm, biological velocity separation, and microbial degradation of feces to treat the park sewage and make efficient ecological fertilizer for the garden maintenance<p>
